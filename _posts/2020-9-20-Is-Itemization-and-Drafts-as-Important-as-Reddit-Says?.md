title: Is Itemization and Drafts as Important as Reddit Says?
---
Being able to understand both Korean and English has been a blessing for me when uncovering ideas and strategy involved in professional League of Legends, but one thing I've noticed with the English speaking side of analysis is their rather obnoxious view on itemization and draft, often calling out players or coaches for either buying the "incorrect" item in a given situation or drafting "badly" into the enemy composition.

The biggest reason why this has stuck out as a sore thumb to me is the attack League of Legends Pro League (LPL) has been underfire by the NA public for what they view is bad itemization and drafts. This became extremely evident to me after the 2020 Summer LPL Final between JD Gaming (JDG) and Top Esports (TES). In the late game both mid laners bought Morellonomicon, which a lot of analysts see as a gold inefficient item (92.97% cost effective) when its passive cannot be utilized effectively.

So let's look at Morellionomicon's sister item, Liandry's Torment. Liandry's when looked at without its passive is actually even more cost inefficient with 78.43% gold efficiency. Now this is why both items are situational. Their value derives from how effectively the champion or player can apply their passives in a given game. The player in question, Yagao, was playing Zoe at the time where, if Zoe is played correctly, has a difficult time stacking these madness stacks effectively for the passive to be worthwhile. So let's say that both items are bad in this circumstance. So then, my question would be what would Yagao build next?

If any real cost analysis was looked at before hand, you'll find that many of the mage items are not cost effective without taking the passive into account. In fact Morellonomicon having a 92.97% gold effeciency is actually one of the highest out of all the mage items without any prerequisites.

Now this brings up another question on my side. Why do people care so much about itemization? Well, funny enough Riot Azael actually brought this up recently in a tweet:
