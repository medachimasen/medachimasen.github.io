title: Summer LPL Finals Game 4 Draft and a Deeper Dive into Win Conditions
---
Throughout 2020, there have been two teams everyone in China have been looking at, JD Gaming (JDG) and Top Esports (TES). And the story is truly amazing. With prodigy Kanavi, getting out of his illegal contract with Griffin, he found his home on the roster of JDG, who test ran him the year before on loan, coupled with the powerful synergy of his topside through Zoom and Yagao. With TES, you have star players in every role: knight, 369, Karsa, and Jackeylove. During Spring Split, TES ended up 1st seed with JDG being on their tail. This led to them being seeded on opposite sides of the brackets for playoffs, which they ended up meeting in finals. This led to an amazing 5 game final with JDG winning out with amazing teamfights.

Then, with Covid-19, instead of Mid-Season Invitational, there was a Mid-Season Cup between LPL and LCK teams. JDG failed to reach the top due to what I see was a bad read on the meta, while TES ended up winning it all. But, this Summer Split, has been just as close as ever. TES ended up getting their first seed, but JDG also placed right behind them yet again. And again, we had a down to the wire finals as we did in Spring Split, with all 5 games being played out. In the end, TES won the bout, but I want to delve into their drafts, specifically game 4.

Here, JDG lost Game 3, so they have side choice, which they opted for Blue side. So here's how the draft went.

Blue (JDG):

Ban 1: Quinn        Pick 1: Graves

Ban 2: Orianna      Pick 2: Zoe
