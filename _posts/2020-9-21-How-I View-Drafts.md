title: How I View Drafts
---
Building off of my previous post on the discussion of itemization, I want to talk more about drafts and how seeing "winning" and "losing" drafts is a rather invalid way of analyzing League of Legends.

When analyzing professional League of Legends games, viewers should understand that pro players are not infalliable, therefore mistakes are often made throughout the game. In fact, as a quick thought experiment, assume that there exists a perfect game state in League of Legends that will always allow you to win your game, but you're not a robot so you're prone to making a mistake in a given game state in every second. So let's say every second in-game you have a 1% chance at making a mistake. My next assumption will be that the game will last 1975 seconds or about 33 minutes (This is based off of the average game length from every region in 2020 before Worlds). By using a binomial distribution $$P(successes = x) = {n \choose x} p^x(1-p)^{n-x}$$. So in this case $$x$$ would be 1975 with $$n$$ being 1975 and $$p$$ is 0.99. The probability that absolutely every move in every given second is perfect, given that the professional player makes the right decision in a given second 99% of the time, is less than 0.0001%. And assuming all 5 players are coordinated perfectly in not making mistakes this probability would be raised to the power of 5. This is a very general experiment, but it does reveal how difficult it is to play the game "perfectly" as some analyst try to push viewers to assume is possible.

So what does this have to do with drafts? Well, while some drafts can be objectively better than others, what matters even more is how the other team denies those teams win conditions or how successfully they execute their own. In order to exemplify this, I want to go into a couple of drafts where people will say that the other team lost because of draft, when it was more because of problems that existed in the execution of the drafts.

For my first example, I want to go into LCK Summer Finals 2020 Game 1, Damwon Gaming (DWG) versus DRX. DWG, as the 1st seed in LCK Summer Regular Season, was given side pick, in which they chose Blue side. The large reason for choosing blue side is priority pick on an extremely strong meta champion that other champions can be drafted around. In this case, one of the biggest first picks in all the major regions have been Caitlyn. Now let's look deeper into the draft.

Patch 10.16

Blue (DWG)

Ban 1: Lucian           Pick 1: Caitlyn

Ban 2: Karma            Pick 2: Volibear

Ban 3: Ashe             Pick 3: Lux

Ban 4: Irelia           Pick 4: Syndra

Ban 5: Ekko             Pick 5: Ornn

Red (DRX)

Ban 1: Pantheon         Pick 1: Jhin

Ban 2: Sett             Pick 2: Lillia

Ban 3: Twisted Fate     Pick 3: Renekton

Ban 4: Hecarim          Pick 4: Pyke

Ban 5: Zoe              Pick 5: Akali

Let's first break down the logic for these draft decisions. DWG's first ban Lucian was aimed at Chovy, DRX's star midlaner. Lucian is extremely strong in the midlane right now with strong burst potential and with correct use of his dash, is very difficult to catch. The second ban, Karma, is to stop the strong flex between top, mid, and support. Doran has had a history of performing with Karma top, so by denying the triple flex, it avoids not being able to counterpick when they could have. Their final ban is towards Ashe. As DWG has first pick, they put priority on being able to pick Caitlyn. One of the strongest answers in the meta is to trade the poke and damage for utility through Ashe, but by denying that opportunity, answering Caitlyn is not as easy. Let's now go through DRX's first round of draft.

DRX's first ban is Pantheon, which LPL and LCK has shown to create huge kill and roam potential as a support and could be flexed as a mid pick. Beryl has shown some games on it already and DWG probably has the effectiveness of Pantheon from extra data such as soloq and scrims. DRX's next ban is against Sett, which has been used as a quadruple flex in Korea as a Top, Jungle, Mid, and Support pick. Sett also has good lockdown which might be a problem if it's easy to burst someone that gets caught out. Their last ban is on Twisted Fate, which has been a high priority Mid pick thoughout the split. When Twisted Fate hits level 6, both lanes will have a difficult time pushing for priority without huge risk of not only worrying about the jungler, but also the mid laner. This can negate a lot of stronger early games from counterpicks and drafts.
