title: How I View Drafts
---
Building off of my previous post on the discussion of itemization, I want to talk more about drafts and how seeing "winning" and "losing" drafts is a rather invalid way of analyzing League of Legends.

When analyzing professional League of Legends games, viewers should understand that pro players are not infalliable, therefore mistakes are often made throughout the game. In fact, as a quick thought experiment, assume that there exists a perfect game state in League of Legends that will always allow you to win your game, but you're not a robot so you're prone to making a mistake in a given game state in every second. So let's say every second in-game you have a 1% chance at making a mistake. My next assumption will be that the game will last 1975 seconds or about 33 minutes (This is based off of the average game length from every region in 2020 before Worlds). By using a binomial distribution $$P(successes = x) = {n \choose x} p^x(1-p)^{n-x}$$. So in this case $$x$$ would be 1975 with $$n$$ being 1975 and $$p$$ is 0.99. The probability that absolutely every move in every given second is perfect, given that the professional player makes the right decision in a given second 99% of the time, is less than 0.0001%. And assuming all 5 players are coordinated perfectly in not making mistakes this probability would be raised to the power of 5. This is a very general experiment, but it does reveal how difficult it is to play the game "perfectly" as some analyst try to push viewers to assume is possible.

So what does this have to do with drafts? Well, while some drafts can be objectively better than others, what matters even more is how the other team denies those teams win conditions or how successfully they execute their own.
