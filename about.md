Thanks for checking in! I'm Ben, a Korean-American 3rd year at the University of Chicago studying Computer Science and Statistics. I plan on making this website a place for me to write my thoughts for different topics I enjoy. These include Esports strategy and data, writeups on personal projects, music reviews, and onward.

### More Information

I've been really ivested in professional League of Legends recently, with my friend, Leon, pushing me to watch The League of Legends Pro League (LPL), or the top level of professional Chinese League of Legends. Since then I've read up much more on how each other major region in professional League of Legends, meta shifts, and large macro trends in the game. Since then, I've been interested in working more with professional League of Legends data, because Leon recommended I get into League of Legends more seriously once I began school at the University of Chicago. I've since been competing at my school for intramurals as well as inter-collegiate League of Legends. I would love to have opportunities to work in this industry so if you have any leads feel free to contact me!

I also love listening to music and have been exposed to it for a very long time. When I was young, my parents would always have me listen to baby classical music, and later pushed me to learn piano (I soon dropped this because I could never push myself to practice). During roadtrips, my dad would always put on some rock music, such as Queen and Simon & Garfunkel. As I became more and more acclimated to the Internet, I exposed myself more rapidly to other genres of music, starting with a more familiar genre of alternative rock with the early stages of Coldplay, to electronic music with Owl City, to hip-hop and rap music with Eminem. I've since exposed myself to all kinds of music and found I don't have a huge preference to any given genre. I usually look for elements in music that make me enjoy it, from mood, lyrics, instrumentals, etc. More recently, I've been looking a lot more into the Korean music industry and their popularity in both Eastern and Western Culture. Artists I've been following since then include: 015B, GroovyRoom, DPR Live, Jay Park, DEAN, and HEIZE.

I will probably add some link to my resume at some point!
